# 365DaysOfCode
Now that I started programming, I've seen a trend of  #100DaysOfCode , I don't quiet understand why stop at 100 , I'd probably stop at 99 or 120 (following runescape rules on maxing a skill), but to make it more interesting I decided I will go for a whole cyclel,here it is my #365DaysOfCode

Plot twist, based on how long each project can take (and because when changing a folders name on a different date, github decides to delete the green contribution mark, making it seem I never worked on that day) from now on it will be #365projects instead of days.
>Will I change the name? nah.<br>
>Should I do it, probably<br>
>Is it clickbait? No, in fact doing it this way may increase the quality of the projects.
