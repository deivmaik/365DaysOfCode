# 2-ColorPicker(TeslaEdition)

I am not big a fan of Teslas way of picking colors , check it out here [tesla](https://www.tesla.com/models/design#paint), but I like Teslas.

>Can I buy a tesla right now? well not really.
>Can I do something about it? probably find a way to make more money , or... I could also try to implement some vanilla javaScript code (as if I would know any other than plain js) to make it posible to change colors in a different way that it is right now.

Ok, it is actually just one function.

Enjoy.
