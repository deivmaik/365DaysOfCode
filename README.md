# Button(RippleEffect)

Well, not much to add here, it's a button with a ripple effect.

>A ripple effect occurs when an initial disturbance to a system propagates outward to disturb an increasingly larger portion of the system, like ripples expanding across the water when an object is dropped into it. The ripple effect is often used colloquially to mean a multiplier in macroeconomics.

Yeah, I never heard about before either.
enjoy!
