# 4-PopUpModal(PseudoLoop)

Yes, I know... those annoying popUps, I personally hate them but it is a good asset to practice modals.
Don't hate me for doing it, if you want to send your hate to anyone do it to this guy. ["Ethan Zuckerman"](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Zuckerman) he created them back in 1997.
In fact he sent his apologies for creating popUps [link to news repport](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/pop-up-ads-creator-ethan-zuckerman-im-sorry-n182096)


Ps. For this one I didnt use the BEM methodology as I usually do, this is the average 'ish' way of doing it.
Once you read through it, you can get the hang out of it, the use of double classes , parent classes etc.

>I am not really sold on the idea of not using BEM but I thought it would be an interesting to try something different this time.<br>
>At the end of the day the only thing that matters are the transitions in CSS and the two functions in JS to make the modal work, so using or not using BEM wouldnt matter much this time, due to the project size (small).

by the way , check out this awesome track that I was listening while coding specially from 6:28 <br> [From Now On Â· Worakls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCg4EfFAtoU) , it really changes your mood in a positive way. 

Hope you enjoy the PseudoLoop! haha.
