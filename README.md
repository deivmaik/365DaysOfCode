>EDIT: Due that somedays I may be unavailable to send commits or that eventually the projects might end up taking more than a day, I've decided to change it to 365Projects instead, one for each day of the year regardless of how long it may take.

Now that I started programming, I've seen a trend of  #100DaysOfCode , I don't quiet understand why stop at 100 , I'd probably stop at 99 or 120 (following runescape rules on maxing a skill), but to make it more interesting I decided I will go for a whole cyclel,here it is my #365DaysOfCode
