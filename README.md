# 365DaysOfCode
 Now that I started programming, I've seen a trend of   #100DaysOfCode , I don't quiet understand why stop at 100 , I'd probably stop at 99 or 120 (following runescape rules on maxing a skill), but to make it more interesting I decided I will go for a whole cyclel,here it is my #365DaysOfCode
