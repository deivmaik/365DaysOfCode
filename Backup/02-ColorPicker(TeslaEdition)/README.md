# 2-ColorPicker(TeslaEdition)

I am not big a fan of Teslas way of picking colors , check it out here [tesla](https://www.tesla.com/models/design#paint), but I like Teslas.

> Can I buy a tesla right now? well not really.
> Can I do something about it? probably find a way to make more money , or... I could also try to implement some vanilla javaScript code to make it possible to change colors in a different way that it is right now.

Ok, it is actually just one function.

Enjoy.
