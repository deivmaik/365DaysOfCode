# 3-ColorFliper(ClubVersion)

I wanted to make an easy random color background generator.

if you click it many times it looks like you are partying. #covidLife

Grab a drink and enjoy while it lasts.

Ps. The gif changes of color fast, so... try to not watch it if you have problems with it, it starts slow supossing you are still reading this so, close if it you need to, or not... up to you.
