# RangeSlider(MaxSpeed)

The fastest car on Earth in 2020 was the SSC Tuatara, made by SSC NorthAmerica (Yeah, I never heard about them either) and it goes at 455.3 km/hr , thats half the speed of an airplane, and to be honest for the price it costs you might as well just buy an airplane.

It costs 1.9 million of dollars at the very basic, so yeah not something many of us can easily get.

Luckily to you! I am here to help you out, if you use the scroll range bellow, you can go as fast or even faster! than the SSC Tuatara.

enjoy!
